# time_synchronization
Using an NTP client to synchronize time and analyze the logs for consistency.

This Python project will involve setting up a simulated logging environment where multiple systems generate logs with timestamps as a part of initiating security measures for a client.

<b>Objectives:</b>
- Set up multiple simulated systems generating logs.
- Implement NTP time synchronization.
- Ingest logs into a central system.
- Analyze logs for time consistency and correlation.
- Implement security measures to protect time synchronization.
